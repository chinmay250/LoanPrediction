### Problem Statement
The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time)
based on customer details provided while filling in the online application form.
These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents,
Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they
have given a problem to identify the customer segments, those are eligible for
loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have
provided a partial dataset.
